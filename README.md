# Avocado Challenge  

This repo contains materials for the Avocado Challenge.

## Avocado Challenge  

The goal of the Avocado challenge is to give a student the oppertunity to demonstrate that they have mastery of the materials covered in the first four modules.

In order to complete the challenge, use the data set found in `data/avocado.csv` to answer the following questions about this [data relating to avocado sales](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices).

You should document your work using a Jupyter Notebook and present a short, 5-7 slide presentation regarding your findings.

> Scenario: You are a independent data scientist asked to provide insights regarding sales of avocados in the United States.

The project should take anywhere from 3-5 hours and must be completed within one week of recieving the project. 
Below is a timeline that suggests how to best allot your time.

## Challenge Check List

* [ ] Create the appropriate visualization for each of the 14 variables.
* [ ] Create at least two bivariate data visualizations (correlations, between group comparisions).
* [ ] Run one t-test related to a business question of your choosing. 
* [ ] Run one univariate linear regression related to a business question of your choosing. 
* [ ] Run one multiple linear regression related to a business question of your choosing. 
* [ ] Run one ANOVA and post-hoc group comparision related to a business question of your choosing. 
* [ ] Prepare 5-7 slides that show three visualizations, one of your regression analyses, and your ANOVA analyses.

## Explanations You Should Be Prepared to Discuss

* [ ] Identify and explain how you dealt with missing data
* [ ] Explain why you chosethe  specific t-test you ran
* [ ] Explain why you would not run other t-tests given the t-test you did run
* [ ] Explain one correlation analysis you did
* [ ] Explain the `statsmodels.summary()` table of your univariate regression analysis 
* [ ] Explain the `statsmodels.summary()` table of your multivariate regression analysis 
* [ ] Explain the `statsmodels.summary()` table of your ANOVA analysis 
* [ ] Be able to explain how Type I, Type II Error, statistical power, and p values relate to each statistical test you run
* [ ] Explain how each statistical analysis can be used to provide a specific business insight related to your responsiblities as a consultant in your chosen scenario.
